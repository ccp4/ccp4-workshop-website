    <h2>Accommodation</h2>

    <p>Rooms for both students and speakers have been arranged at
      <a href="http://www.thebearwantage.co.uk/">The Bear hotel</a> in Wantage.
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wantage">Wantage</a>
      is a small market town, about 8 miles west of Diamond, which claims to be the birthplace of King Alfred.
      Wantage has a good range of shops, pubs, restaurants and a local sports centre, plus regular
      buses to the Harwell Campus, Oxford, Didcot and beyond. The
      Bear hotel is in the market square (town centre) and dates from the 16th
      century, with many traditional features, including oak beams in the bar
      and restaurant. Visitors with some spare time in the town will find that
      the museum immediately behind the hotel offers a
      good insight into the history of the local area.</p>

    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <!--p>We will arrange shuttle transfers each morning and evening, but for those
who wish to travel at different times during the day the bus stop is directly
outside the hotel.</p-->
    <p></p> The Oxford Bus Company
    <a href="https://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/services/THTR/X35">X35</a>
    route serves the Harwell campus and picks up in Wantage immediately
    outside The Bear. Suitable bus times are included on the
    <a href="programme.php">programme</a>. Coach transport will be provided
    on the evening of the data collection day and on Sunday when the bus
    timetable is reduced.</p>

    <p>Parking at The Bear is not free, but cheap parking is available nearby.</p>
