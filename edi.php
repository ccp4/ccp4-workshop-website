<h2 style="clear:both">Statement on equity and inclusion</h2>
  <p<b>The organisers are committed to making the school productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity, 
       sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality or religion/belief.</p> 
  <p>We will not tolerate harassment of participants – students or tutors – in any form.</p>
  <p>We are committed to achieving a balanced and diverse panel of speakers at all our events by inviting speakers of all 
     races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientation without compromising the quality, and 
     remaining within the topic, of the programme.  All speakers will have agreed to the Code of Conduct prior to agreeing 
     to speak at the event.</p>
  <p>As part of the registration process, attendees will be required to agree to adhere to the CCP4 Code of Conduct (see below).
<h2 style="clear:both">The CCP4 Code of Conduct</h2>
  <p>Behave professionally.</p>
  <p>Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. 
     Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, 
     deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive or 
     belittling comments related to sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, 
     ethnicity, nationality or religion/belief.</p>
  <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. 
     Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.</p>
  <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.</p>
  <p>Delegates are reminded that the organisers reserve the right to remove any person who does not adhere to the code of conduct.</p>
  <h2 style="clear:both">Incident reporting and resolution</h2>
  <p>If you observe someone making you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please tell them so, and remind them of the Code of Conduct.
     If you are hesitant about addressing the person yourself, report it as soon as possible to a member of the Organising Committee 
     - see contact information below. The Committee is committed to addressing and resolving the matter to the best of their abilities.</p>
     Please use the <a title="Contact us" href="contact.php">Contact us</a> section here, and explain what happened and who was involved 
     so that we can investigate.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your participation in the CCP4 community, and your efforts to keep our conference welcoming, respectful, and friendly for all participants!</p></b>
<h2 style="clear:both">Sanctions</h2>
  <p>When someone is asked to stop any behaviour that makes others uncomfortable, they are expected to comply immediately.</p>
  <p>In response to inappropriate behaviour (e.g. sexual content, rudeness, unprofessional) organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, 
     including warning the person in question, asking them to leave the event, or removing them from a mailing list.</p>
  <p>Specific actions may include but are not limited to:</p>
  <li>asking the person to cease the inappropriate behaviour, and warning them that any further reports will result in other sanctions
  <li>requiring that the person avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, another person for the remainder of the event
  <li>early termination of a talk that violates the policy
  <li>not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violates the policy
  <li>not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event
  <li>immediately ending any event responsibilities or privileges held
  <li>requiring that the person immediately leave the event and not return
  <li>blocking the person on social media platforms (for a defined time period)
  <li>banning the person from future events (for a defined time period)
  <li>publishing an anonymous account of the harassment
  <li>reporting the incident to the person’s employer
