<h2>The CCP4-BCA Summer School returns to the North!</h2> 
<p><b>It is a great pleasure to announce the return of the CCP4-BCA Summer School on 
      macromolecular crystallography and associated techniques. Running for the first 
      time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the school aims to bring together early-career
      scientists from the UK, Europe and beyond and train them in the latest advances
      in structural biology, with a primary focus on macromolecular crystallography. </b></p>

<p><b>All aspects of structure solution will be covered during the
workshop, from data collection through to phasing, refinement,
validation and deposition.</b></p>
<ul>
<b>
  <li> Lectures and tutorials will be delivered by experts in the field, sometimes even software authors themselves!
  <li> An exciting social programme will showcase some of the best the historical City of York can offer - and in summer.
  <li> You will be able to work alongside world-leading scientists and methods developers on your own projects.
</b>
</ul>
